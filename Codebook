Introduction:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

We have 180 records and 563 variables. 

The first variables indentify the subject who carried out the experiment and the second variable indicates the activity the subject is undertaking. 

The remaining 561 columns are the average values of the 561 variables captured by the phone with time and frequency domains
